Even though I don't change my OS too frequently. I almost always end up tinkering around with it once every 2-3 months. I keep finding myself coming back to Canonicals Ubuntu, mostly because everything 'just works'. Lets hope, that someday, I can muster the courage to take the leap and purify myself on the path to the *Arch Way*. Till then, let me fill my pockets with Ubuntu releases.

Whats the most important thing on a fresh OS install? Definitely the looks, I would say. I started with installing the `unity-tweak-tool`, a system-wide GTK3+ theme `Arc-Dark`<sup>[link](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme)</sup>, and an icon pack `paper-icon-theme`<sup>[link](https://snwh.org/paper/icons)</sup>.


```shell
sudo apt install -y unity-tweak-tool

# Arc theme
wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:Horst3180/xUbuntu_15.10/Release.key
sudo apt-key add - < Release.key
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/Horst3180/xUbuntu_15.10/ /' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arc-theme.list"
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install arc-theme

# Paper icons
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:snwh/pulp
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y paper-icon-theme # paper-gtk-theme
```

Amazingly, the `Arc-Dark` theme has a complimentary [Arc-Firefox theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-firefox-theme) to go with it. It has some inconsistencies, which I fixed using simple stylesheets.

```css
/* https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox#Unreadable_input_fields_with_dark_GTK.2B_themes
 * Add the below css to
 * ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/chrome/userContent.css
*/
input:not(.urlbar-input):not(.textbox-input):not(.form-control):not([type='checkbox']) {
    -moz-appearance: none !important;
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
}

#downloads-indicator-counter {
    color: white;
}

textarea {
    -moz-appearance: none !important;
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
}

select {
    -moz-appearance: none !important;
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
}
```

Now that my desktop looked pretty. It was time for some functionality.

* **Synaptic** : Although using `apt` is really easy. It's always good to have a a graphical package manager for times when you're lazy ;P
* **gdebi** : Installing .deb files with command line is pure torture (wait until you have unmet dependecies and watch the hell burn down). Instead, just install gdebi and let the demon die.
* **nautilus-dropbox** : I use dropbox a lot. I don't like being dependent on software, but hell I'm dependent on dropbox. I mostly use it to work on projects across different devices. And *everything* else too. I literally don't use my hard disk at all, apart for local dropbox storage ofcourse. This bugs me a lot to be honest, I might think of encrypting everything before uploading on dropbox. Will have to read their TOS first.
* **keepassx** : I feel that I could talk a lot more about a password manager than the scanty space available in this puny unordered list.

I also installed the following:

* **atom**: a text editor.
* **Chrome**: Incase firefox fails me.
* **GitKraken**: graphic git
* **HexChat**: IRC - `MiteshNinja`
* **kdenlive**: video editor.
* **NeoVim**: yet another text editor.
* **simplescreenrecorder**: simple screen recorder.
* **Steam**
* **umake**: ubuntu-make to install PyCharm and CLion.
* **VLC**
* **zsh**: get this. now.

Some of the above programs were installed using these commands:

```shell
sudo apt install -y synaptic gdebi nautilus-dropbox keepassx kdenlive google-chrome zsh

# Screen recorder
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maarten-baert/simplescreenrecorder
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y simplescreenrecorder
```

The only thing I lack is a decent email notification system. I am currently using a simple python + cron script to get the job done, but I'll soon be writing an appindicator/status bar application to get that to check my emails for me.

I also set up my terminal, which I've described in this [post](http://computableverse.com/blog/my-terminal-setup).

What do *you* do on a fresh OS install?
